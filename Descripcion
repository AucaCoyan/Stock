Stock management software

The idea is to work in a program about stock. (It is specially designed for companies like SACDE)
Firstly it is going to have
todo -a module to manage products (Add, Rename, Remove, etc) With description box
todo -include receipts, with supplier, specification, and placing in the site (if available)
todo -list of workers, with sector and his/her superior)
todo -loan tools to workers, to know who you lend what
todo -Table of suppliers, and data of contact
todo -a module to print receipts in PDF files, either for suppliers or for lendings
todo -a Visual application


Later on, things like

-broken items or re categorization will be processed
